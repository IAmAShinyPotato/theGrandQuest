# theGrandQuest
A game starring Parker, written entirely in Python.

The game is in it's _*VERY*_ early stages, and is nowhere near completion.

## How do you play?
*(sorry, Windows only -- I have no experiences with other OSes!)*

First, make sure you have Python 3 installed -- this game was written in Python 3.10, but 3.5 and above have been tested to work.

Next, download the latest release, and extract all the files into a folder.

Right clicking on main.py, select "Open with", then Python.
